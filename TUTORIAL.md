# Welcome!

Welcome to the remix-shopify workshop
Together we will create a frontend for a shopify store.

How this will be done?
We are going to take a real store - wearjs.com
and rebuild its UI using Remix.

# How is it going to work

You will get an application which is implemented in Remix but without its full potential
The current version is a client side rendered application.
You will be working on the branch named "CSR".
Your task is to turn the application to a server side rendered application.

We will follow you step by step and help you with any questions you might have.
Let's get started!

- You can work in pairs or alone.
